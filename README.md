### Keywords
Travel service, support program, cost, outdoor activity, travel, mobility, visually impaired, app development, user experience

### Summary
#### 1) Travel Preparation and Preferences of Visually Impaired Individuals
- Recently, visually impaired travelers have been preparing for trips using standards similar to those of non-disabled individuals.
- They consider general factors like schedule, destination, and meals rather than having separate limitations.
- However, difficulties in mobility still exist, making the presence of a companion very important.

#### 2) Companion Support and the Role of Welfare Centers
- During outdoor activities organized by the welfare center, assigning one volunteer per visually impaired participant is often not feasible.
- The center recruits volunteers separately or encourages participants to bring family members or personal care assistants.
- The biggest challenge in actual operations is securing sufficient manpower.

#### 3) Experiential Content and Sensory Elements
- While experiential activities were previously considered the most preferred, visually impaired individuals today are open to a wider range of experiences.
- Scenery and landscapes can be indirectly enjoyed through verbal descriptions provided by companions.
- Vivid verbal explanations play a crucial role in enhancing the overall travel experience.

#### 4) Travel Challenges and Information Accessibility
- The biggest difficulty during travel is ‚Äúmobility,‚Äù which is directly tied to the presence of a travel companion.
- Some individuals can travel alone, but they need to be comfortable with asking for help from those around them.
- Tourism support programs for the visually impaired offered by certain municipalities (e.g., Suwon, Gyeongju) are not well known due to a lack of accessible information.
- Since visually impaired individuals often have limited access to information, active promotion by organizing institutions is essential.

#### 5) Feedback on Apps and Services for the Visually Impaired
- Although there are many apps designed specifically for visually impaired users, actual usability varies widely depending on the individual.
- The main issues are less about the app functionality itself and more about lack of user-friendliness and overly complex UI design.

### Conclusion and Implications
- Travel for the visually impaired has become more accessible than in the past, but support in terms of human resources and information remains a critical issue.
- Rather than the disability itself, factors like information accessibility, availability of companions, and mobility assistance determine the quality of the travel experience.
- Future service planning should go beyond visual content and consider incorporating descriptive interfaces, experiential substitutes, and information curation features.

### Summary
#### 1) Importance of Travel Companions
- For visually impaired individuals, ‚Äúwho they travel with‚Äù is the top consideration when planning a trip.
- While traveling alone is physically possible, the need for repeated assistance throughout the journey presents significant practical limitations.
- They usually travel with friends or family; if not available, a personal care assistant (PCA) accompanies them.
- However, the full cost of hiring a PCA must be borne by the individual, creating a heavy financial burden.

#### 2) Travel Routes and Itinerary Planning
- The travel destination is often chosen directly by the visually impaired person.
- Travel routes (e.g., efficient paths, where to stop for lunch) are typically planned by the sighted companion.
- Details such as parking availability or the presence of steep slopes are difficult for visually impaired travelers to check themselves.

#### 3) Preference for Hands-On Experiences
- Compared to visually centered attractions like museums or exhibitions, they tend to prefer experiential activities.
- While auditory descriptions are necessary, excessive information can lead to fatigue.
- Places involving hands-on food preparation or kiosks that are hard to use are generally avoided due to inconvenience.

#### 4) Financial and Practical Constraints
- Traveling with a PCA doubles the cost (transportation, meals, accommodation, etc.).
- For two people, total trip costs can exceed several million KRW.
- If the PCA cannot drive, travelers often need to request vehicle support.

#### 5) Information Accessibility and Matching Services
- It is difficult to access detailed information about travel destinations, so they often rely heavily on reviews.
- Some welfare centers (e.g., Hasang Center for the Disabled) provide websites with menu and destination information.
- Matching with volunteers is a sensitive issue due to trust concerns; verified matching systems are essential to prevent incidents.

#### 6) Demand for Disability-Friendly Routes
- Routes with gentle slopes or simple activities (e.g., cable cars, rail bikes) receive positive feedback.
- Certain locations, like caves, may trigger fear or claustrophobia ‚Üí prior information is crucial.
- The presence of stairs or the choice of starting point can significantly affect difficulty ‚Üí comparative info between point A and B should be provided.

#### Conclusion and Implications
- For visually impaired individuals, travel is not just sightseeing‚Äîit‚Äôs a safe, companion-centered experiential journey.
- Practical information (e.g., slope gradients, activity accessibility, dining convenience) greatly influences travel decisions.
- Services must address real issues like cost burden, reliable companion matching, and lack of accessible information to create meaningful solutions.

# POC(Point Of Concept)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e21c8a8b-31f2-446c-b875-0c3c23b2b385)

## Purpose

To identify pain points in the travel experiences of visually impaired individuals and validate the need for an accessibility-focused travel information and navigation app based on real user insights.

## Key Themes

- Difficulties faced by visually impaired individuals while traveling and possible improvements  
- Importance of accessibility-focused design and dedicated apps for the visually impaired  
- Recommendations for improving accessibility at tourist destinations

## Travel Stage Insights

### 1. Pre-Travel (Planning Phase)

- Information searching is possible, but planning travel routes is cited as the biggest challenge.  
- YouTube and blogs are frequently used for research, but there‚Äôs a lack of refined, accessible information.  
- Accessibility of terrain (e.g., stairs, road conditions) is a key factor when choosing destinations.

### 2. During Travel *(optional)*

- Visually impaired travelers prefer experience-based activities (e.g., leisure sports, local food, fishing).  
- There are cases where participation is restricted at tourist sites due to visual impairment ‚Äî perceived as discrimination.

### 3. Post-Travel *(optional)*

- Travel memories are often recorded through photos or shared verbally.  
- Writing text-based diaries is difficult; map-based review features often lack accessibility.  
- Community engagement is relatively low due to unfamiliarity and inconvenient UI.

## Desired Features

> üí° Feedback: *"An app that is truly usable by visually impaired people must focus on **simplicity, accessibility, and essential functionality.***"

- Route optimization  
- Summarized reviews  
- Easy reservation system  
- Collection of experience-based activities accessible for visually impaired users

## Conclusion & Service Necessity

- The travel experience of visually impaired individuals is shaped by **who they travel with**, **what information they can access**, and **how they move around**.  
- Features such as **AI-based route recommendations** and **condensed, accessible travel information** are highly practical.  
- More important than adding new technology is **focusing on accessibility and simplicity** ‚Äî apps must be designed around core, essential features.
