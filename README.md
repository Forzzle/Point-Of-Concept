### Summary
#### Inquiry on Planning a Travel Service for the Visually Impaired
Contacted the Korea Blind Welfare Center to plan a travel service for the visually impaired.
Aimed to identify travel-related challenges and inconveniences specific to visually impaired individuals, unlike general travel.
Gathered information on priorities when visually impaired people travel (mobility obstacles, schedules, locations, meals, etc.).

#### Operation of Support Programs
Considering mobility challenges, programs offer companion support or volunteer matching.
Costs related to volunteer matching are either covered by the program budget or borne individually.
Various opportunities and considerations for visually impaired individuals were discussed.

#### Challenges in Outdoor Activities and Solutions
Outdoor activities require at least one caregiver per visually impaired individual. It is important to confirm whether family accompanies the trip or activity supporters are available.
Securing personnel is the greatest difficulty, while location and cost are secondary concerns.
Visually impaired individuals prefer experience-based travel and can enjoy activities through verbal descriptions from companions.

#### Travel Difficulties and the Importance of Mobility
Mobility was mentioned as the biggest challenge during travel.
Traveling alone is difficult even when reaching the information desk due to distance and lack of guidance at destinations.
It was assumed that those who wish to travel alone may not feel uncomfortable asking for help from others.

#### Analysis of Support Programs and App Status
Tourism support programs for the visually impaired are underway in cities like Suwon and Gyeongju, but lack of accessible information leads to low usage.
Apps for the visually impaired lack user-friendliness and may cause inconvenience.
Emphasized the need for proactive promotion by program organizers due to limited information channels.

#### Feedback on App Development and User Experience Improvement
Identified the need to address user discomfort with existing apps.
Collected information through direct interviews with visually impaired users.
Suggested additional visits and field studies at the Busan Blind Welfare Center.

### Summary
Travel Challenges and the Importance of Companions
Conducted interviews to understand perceptions and challenges of travel among visually impaired individuals.
The need for a companion is the top priority for visually impaired travelers, and traveling alone is very difficult.
Cited difficulties in route finding and enjoying the essence of travel when alone.

#### Travel Planning and Route Design
Mentioned potential cost burdens when traveling with acquaintances.
Travel routes are usually set by the planner, and visually impaired individuals often rely on companions for the itinerary.
Asked about their personal experiences and feelings during travel.

#### Analysis of Travel Experiences
Little difference between travel experiences in Jeju Island and Pohang’s seaside.
Preferred experience-based activities over visual-focused ones.
Visual-based activities like museum visits are less memorable and tiring.
Avoided audio-only explanations during planning; however, such activities might be unavoidable when traveling with sighted individuals.

#### Factors Increasing Travel Expenses
Increased economic burden due to the need for more companions.
Shared an example where a trip that costs 300,000 KRW for a solo traveler increased to 2.5 to 3 million KRW when traveling with a spouse and two activity assistants.

#### Travel Difficulties and Green Travel (Chorok Travel)
Travel is hindered by expenses related to transportation and accommodation.
Asked about vehicle support during trips with visually impaired friends and mentioned Kia’s Green Travel program.
Suggested that Green Travel’s support and accommodation services are inconvenient and need improvement.

#### Seeking Ways to Improve Travel Convenience
Explored ways to resolve issues such as stairs and mobility paths.
Proposed the use of an AI-based travel planning app and discussed its usability concerns.
Mentioned difficulties in independently planning trips and issues like parking accessibility.

#### Difficulty in Providing Accessible Tourist Information
Visually impaired individuals have difficulty checking for features like parking lots or stairs.
Optimal route planning is hard when incline direction changes based on starting points, such as on cliffside trails.
In places like Mungyeong Saejae, where route elevation varies by choice, detailed reviews are necessary.

#### Conceptualizing a Travel Assistant System
Travel plans are usually made after searching blogs and checking reviews.
Route planning considers terrain (e.g., uphill/downhill), and dining preferences (e.g., grilled meat type).
Plans to use websites that offer information on accessibility and to consider negative reviews (e.g., poor service, uncomfortable dining).
App concept: matching service
Plans to develop a volunteer-matching service via the app. However, concerns about safety and trust remain.
Raised issues regarding language barriers and incidents when matching users across languages.
Recognized the need for a secure meeting system, similar to second-hand trading apps like “Karrot Market,” and emphasized the need for further review.

#### Improving Accessibility at Tourist Sites: Experience-Focused Tourism and Cautions
Experience-based tourism (cable cars, monorails, rail bikes) is suitable for the visually impaired. Cave tours are possible but require caution due to narrow passages and stairs.
Experiences like mine trains are comfortable, but narrow cave passages may cause claustrophobia or physical constraints.
Highlighted the need for accessibility improvements and safety precautions due to narrow cave entrances.

#### Experiences in Narrow Passages and the Importance of Companions
Discussed fear and trauma from passing through narrow cave passages.
Mentioned the difference in care received when traveling with friends/family versus activity assistants.
Pointed out that travel with activity assistants may involve concerns (e.g., accommodation) due to the professional nature of the relationship.

#### Seeking Safe Travel Solutions for the Visually Impaired
Discussed ways to ensure safe and convenient travel for the visually impaired.
Mentioned the possibility of using travel agencies for the disabled and connecting with local guides for overseas trips.
Emphasized the need to explore solutions for financial difficulties that occur during travel.
